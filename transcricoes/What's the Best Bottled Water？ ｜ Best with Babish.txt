 Fellow Patriots, welcome back to what is and always has been my militant and entrenched beacon of absolute truth. We're at war, fellow Patriots, with the feckless idolatrous, cockledrous thugs who are now coming for you, for your freedoms, your autonomy, your agency, your... your penis sons. And it's up to you to rise up in arms against them. The past teaches us that the future is at stake. April Fools. The past and future are imagined illusions, the only time that exists is the present moment. The only objective experience is your subjective experience and you are originally a being of light and love. Anyway, bottled water, the very building blocks of life. Now bottled and sold to you at a tremendous upcharge, creating both waste and an economy all its own. And now I'm going to tell you how it takes. None of these are carbonated, none of these have flavors, but the only thing that they have is differing pH and minerality levels. So this is going to drive me to the very edge of sanity where I already am, so it's probably... I might push me off. We'll see. You know, here at the BCU we like to have fun. This is an exercise in wanton waste and plasticity. Not the good kind, the... kind. Water scarcity is a very real thing that affects more than a quarter of the world's population. 2.2 billion people do not have reliable access to clean drinking water. It's why I have in the past partnered with the Ugandan Water Project. Based out of my hometown of Rochester, New York, I've worked with them to build three wells in rural Uganda. And with this episode we're going to build a fourth well. I encourage you to check out the link in the description below. Then you can fund the construction of a water reclamation system that can provide clean drinking water for over 100 people. We will be donating all the bottles that we don't drink today to a nearby homeless shelter and we will never buy bottled water again. The last one with an asterisk, if I'm really thirsty. And if there's nothing else, I'm not a saint. Which water is this one? Gacha, aprophils. That tastes like absolutely nothing. It's water. Maybe before we get started we should talk a little bit about the rating system here. I'm just going to go with my gut on each one. There's no baseline. I'm just going to f***ing say what comes into my heart. Not my head. You'll notice I did that on purpose. That tastes like normal water. No sugar in it. There's no bubbles. There's no pizza. So I'm going to give it a six. It tastes nice and clean. Nothing special. What do we got? Okay. Crystal Geyser, natural Alpine spring water by CG Roxanne, bottled at the source in a frata, New York. Where are all these places I've never heard of? Well, this is a cheap water. I've seen this around and that's that. I will chug every glass that Nico gives me. What's the toxic amount of water? There is an amount. There is an amount of sugar. Next up we have more water, perfectly clear. It has a water-like texture. There's nothing I could possibly cleanse my palate with. Air? I feel like I am actually detecting something which is absurd. I want to say minerality, but I might be absolutely imagining it. I think I like it, but I have the last one. My gut instinct says I like this better. I'm going to give this a seven. What do we got? Well, it's not mineral, but it is more expensive. So bring situated in scores in Italy. Total dissolved solids, 296 solids. It doesn't say a unit. It just says total dissolved solids, 296. All right, maybe the mineral sun. I think I do taste minerals, I do. Maybe I am an asshole. Who can taste the difference between waters? Nothing in there. Oh, that is a cardboard flavor to it. Wow, I'm actually tasting differences. This is f***ing bananas. I have a preference about this. This is incredible. It's so, so faint. It's, I might, again, I might be imagining it. It could be imagining everything. I mean, I could be imagining this. This could be a dream. I can't prove that it's not. So I'm going to give it a four, because I don't like it. But I would drink it. It is origin, refreshingly American spring water. Enough of these Italian waters. Perfectly balanced and naturally occurring electrolytes for crisp and refreshing taste. Maybe that's what I was tasting. The electrolytes. My learning what electrolytes taste like. I can't really detect anything about it. I think I detect slinity. The back of my tongue kind of picks up on like a little tang, which I think might indicate sodium presence or minerality or something. It seems very inoffensive. I would give it a five. It's normal water. Zen water. Zen water. 100% recycled ocean-bound plastic. Does that mean that this is headed for the ocean? It's recycled from plastic that was in the ocean. Oh. Well, I mean philosophically, yes. We're all headed for the ocean. Every Zen water bottle is made from up to five bottles. Rescued from at-risk coastal environments preventing them from reaching and polluting the ocean. Zen water is also the world's first beverage to be certified plastic negative. I feel inclined to raise this point. So I'm going to give it a six for nobility. Way to go Zen water. Way to save stuff. Okay. It's water. Why not have a stomach ache? Doesn't make any sense. That's got a crisp or refreshing taste. This one especially tastes like nothing. Six. I don't know. Six. It's good. It's good. It's eternal. It's eternal water sourced from naturally alkaline springs. It arrived in this bottle as nature intended. It's eternally perfect. It arrived in this bottle as nature intended. Six. I see little bubbles in this one. We're particulate. You can see that? Seriously? Yeah, there's particulate in this. That's interesting. It tastes nothing. Up six. No, it has sh** floating in it. Five. I don't know what that stuff is floating in there. Smart water. Purely you can taste hydration. You can feel. Yeah, there's little sh** floating in this bottle. Clouds might throw us some shade. But they give us nature's purest source of water. What? I misread that. Wow, it's so close to being very bad. We think that's pretty smart. So we took inspiration from our puffy white friends. And I definitely saw that as purely white friends. I definitely misread that. But still, watch your mouth. Then we one up to nature and add in electrolytes for crisp, clean taste. We think nature's pretty smart. We're smarter. That is hubris. Defined. Well, I'm annoyed by the packaging, but not enough to dock it. Stays at a five. Okay. Nothing floating around in this guy. That's an improvement. Okay. I have to be imagining that. I have to be imagining the flavor. There's something I want to say vegetal about it. I wouldn't call it a pleasant taste though. I don't think I like it, so I'm going to give it a four. Oh my goodness. Well, at least it is mineral. Aquapana served in the best restaurants. That's their tagline. That's f***ing annoying. The heritage of taste. That is poor design. Crafted by nature, aquapana is slowly filtered through the hills of Tuscany. It is a symbol of Tuscan taste. It's a taste of unmistakable taste in every bottle. I didn't want to say it tastes like garlic that it kind of did. I swear to God I tasted something reminiscent of garlic. Instead I said vegetable because I didn't want to sound like a psycho. One of the more expensive names in water. I'm not crazy about its flavor. I think I see miniscule things floating, but I think they're all going upward, which indicates that their little bubbles left over from the pouring process. Maybe minerality doesn't have the same like off flavor as aquapana. I don't mind it, but I'm not like over the moon about it, but I don't not like it, so I'll give it a six. Oh f***ing. Damn it. Everything's bullshit. Everything's made up. I made up your made up. This is spring water. It's pulling spring. Taste good, finder. It's good, finder. No discernible smell. Nothing. Six. I got nothing. Yeah, it's another expensive one. It gives us f***ing about anything. The mountain valley. Spring water bottled in the Wachita Mountains, USA. Oh, here's a pronunciation guy. Wachita Mountains, USA. And it's owned by DS Services of America, I have romantic. It was a bottled Arkansas. Cool. Okay. Well, that's that. Please let one of these taste like something. Please. It would just be a crazy one to do if I took a bite. I'm having fun. F***ing sex. What is it? Ah, it's gatorade. Gatorade water. It does have salinity. You could have fooled me. I'm flavored, alkaline, electrolyte and fused. Then there we go. I'm going to give it everything that's sex from now on. That's it. That's it. I gave up. How many deep are we? Because I give up. It's like five left. This is starting to get actually a little disheartening. So I don't know what I'm going to do for 25 more waters. I feel lost. I need something to taste like something. Anything. I think I taste salinity in this one. It's making my mouth, it's making my salivary glands go. So I feel like I taste salinity. The last time I said that, it was fricking pollen spring. So who knows? I'm going to say it has salinity and it's another six. Icelandic glacial pH of 8.4. This is a very high pH. Over 5,000 years ago, long before the first humans reached remote Iceland, a massive volcanic eruption. I'm riveted. Created a unique underground spring, complete with its own natural filtration system, pristine lava rock. This is the origin of Icelandic glacial. The natural spring water was the source of an epic life. Hellia. So there you go, six. What's some criteria to look for? Sure. So if you were for a structure, softness or hardness, I don't know what any of those are. Aftertaste and persistence. Persistence. Pretty soft. Very watery structure. And aftertaste, I call it reminiscent of water. And it persists not. Zero. I don't know. What does that mean? Neutral, I guess. Neutral, five. Ooh, a gallon jug right on time. Instant spring water. With fluoride added. Uses include formula, cereal, juices. And cereal, kind of monstrous, are you trying to raise here? What the hell makes this for infants? Though I do know it's important. So if you have an infant, don't just go feeding it any old water. Get some of this stuff. God, I got nothing. I have nothing. I've never had a Neon in good shape personally. But I got nothing from this water. Maybe the faintest hint of cardboard taste. That is what my gut first said on the first sip. And now when I take a sip, and then inhale air like that, I get a cardboard taste. So I have to really, really try and do a specific sequence of actions to taste something. So you get a form. Why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, and clean up our oceans for every bottle, purchased, we collect the equivalent of up to five bottles from an oceanbound waterway, beach or city. Slow climate change, lowest eco footprint of any beverage packaging. I'm bumping up, I'm bumping up, y'all up. Okay, I'm not going to punish you for being so awesome. Live ethically. God, there's a lot going on back here making me feel good about myself. For every case sold, why a key it provides a month's supply of clean water to those in need, while contributing those to local nonprofits and support of the most vulnerable here in Hawaii through our award-winning Kokua Initiative. Another point, six. I'm bumping this up to six. Might not taste great, or maybe I'm imagining that. Maybe our air tastes like cardboard. No, but they're doing good stuff. All good things it would seem. So six. Okay, some going on here. Something's happening here. That tastes like hose water and not water that belongs to hose. I mean, hose like a hose water. Distincts, like rubbery or plasticine taste. Wow, finally, something. Something I have, a life draft, I can hang on to. I have a soft spot for hose water. When I was young, we would go camping. The only water we'd store in the little water tanks and it would come out through a hose. So it was being stored in these tanks and come out through your average garden hose. So it was really getting imparted with a lot of flavors. And then we would boil pasta in it. And the pasta would taste like hose water. And I would only need noodles with butter on it back then because I was a petulant child. So it would taste like hose water noodles. And I kind of like something. I personally like it. I'm going to give it a six. Where we got it? It's New York City tap water. Whoa. I tasted the difference between bottle and tap water. I am a god. And here's the thing about tap water. I could be tasting the water system in my house. I could be tasting my pipes. It's not that don't blame New York City tap water. We're great bagels and pizza come from. Glad you snuck that one in there. Nicely done. It's more surprised as come. Stay tuned, folks. You hear that? Right after this. Are we clear? I don't know how I'm going to clear that tap water that tastes out of my mouth. Hmm. It could very well be residual from the last water but it tastes like kind of a plastic scene. Microplastic. I don't think it is though because it's a different kind of... It's like a different flavor of plastic. Last one was hose. This one's like the plastic that like toys come in. Either way, I'm not crazy about it. I wonder if that's microplastics. Am I tasting the doom of humankind right now? I don't like it for. Oh, thank god. Wow. Aquafina. Pure water, perfect taste. My ass. No stories. No point of origin. Bottle by C.P.F. Incorporated. That sounds like a chemical plastic f***ing odds. C.P.F. Incorporated. It doesn't taste very good. And I'm thrilled that I actually could taste that this didn't taste very good. And they don't even do the thinner cap. Like my man Crystal Geyser over here. See the cap diff? That's what's going to save us. This is version plus. It's here. I'm inclined to dock it. Let's drop this two or three. You were right to think Aquafina is bad. Me. Let's talk to myself. Water. Really neutral. I'm not getting any characteristics of it. It's super neutral. There's nothing offensive, nothing exciting about it. It's five. I'll give this one a five. Oh, sweet Saratoga. No. This brand that makes you feel like you're drinking the water from the water boy. Like that you made it. Appreciate it. That's water from a glacier in Alaska. Perfectly refined taste. Sourced from carefully curated spring Saratoga spring water as a smooth taste. That effortlessly compliments fine meals and spirits. That is the most country club description I've ever heard in my entire life. I'd say it's still worth the money because of the cool bottle. Oh my god. I can't wait to find out what this one is. This is good. Yeah. The salinity is just right. And the minerality is like there. It's not cloying. I'd love to try this cold. It'd probably be fan f***ing plastic. We have our first ten other hands. No, it's April Fool's f***ing. It's like water. Happy prank skiving. Yeah, I mean, all jokery aside. It tastes pretty clean and balanced and normal. I'll give it a seven. I do like it. It's only part of the big part of that was acting, but some of it was genuine. It's why you believed me. Ah, sencha. pH quality guaranteed. Clean smooth taste, purified water, enhanced electrolytes. Ah, Nestle. Six. Got to be version of plastic. They're not saying that it's recycled anywhere. It is Nestle and I'm sure that it's expensive. Yeah. A lot of stuff swimming around in this. I don't like that. I feel like I'm getting like a... little chloreny kind of vibe. There's an odd flavor. It's not on the back end. It does not persist. It hits you immediately as soon as you taste and then it goes away. I don't think I like it so I'm going to go with my gut and give it for. pH perfection. 9.5 plus. What is the scale? Is this going to burn a hole in my stomach? Zero we have battery acid. At 14 we have drain cleaner. What's nine? Baking soda? Wait, wait, wait, wait. If you mix vinegar and baking soda and acid with a base, it foams up. I'm dying for stimuli of any kind. If I take this innocent looking bottle of apple cider vinegar, I'm sure there's a reason it's not happening. I'm sure this probably has a pH of 9.5 plus. But why didn't it just become a child's volcano science fair project? Should I try this water? I'm going to screw it in my palate. It tastes acidic but I don't know if that's just the apple cider vinegar I just drank. Do one more. Now my tongue is reacting to salt or electrolytes or minerals or something. This tastes like a laden water. And again, if this comes out being heavy on or something, then I'm full of s***. But I think I taste salinity. Five. Sammy, are you kidding me? It's actually heavy. Made by the French Alps. Is it mineral water? Natural electrolytes. Oh. Our ingredients come from nature. So that's how it's spelled. This bottle is made from bottles. I was expecting more. And it's just this bottle is made from bottles. It's still like kind of tangy on my tongue. This stuff must have crazy amounts of minerals and electrolytes. Thank you. Just Norson. How? Why do you have me do that? Wait, why are there bubbles on the outside of the glass? That hasn't happened with any water thus far. I've snorted it again. I'm a trained professionalist. A closed course. Don't do what I just did. Don't snort water. It hurts. It's dumb and you'll die. You get a brain parasite. One more time. No. Aperol. Why have there bubbles? Is this like homemade water? Did you make this? It's your piss. Cardboard. Tastes like cardboard. Don't like snorts. Okay. Don't like those bubbles. I'm going to dock it for that. And for the cardboard. It's going to give my first three of the day. Oh no! No. No. Liquid death. This brand is an example of genius in marketing. To which I myself have fallen victim. I frequently buy their sparkling water because I like the tall boy cans. You know, I like canned water because it is more friendly on the environment. And it's easier to drink in my mind. So I'll bump them up to a four. This one has small bubbles on the sides. It's on bottom. It's just this glass. Am I penalizing them for nothing? I'm going to sound effect in there. I'm just using my doing that. And then leave it in the part. So you'll hear it. And then I'll be like, put it in a sound effect. And then like, what? And they'll hear it twice. It'll be incredible. Leave this part in. This is fine. Give it a five. Really? Yeah. I don't know. Oh no! And this gets knocked down to four because I don't see anything about it being recycled. Except that it's a 100% right cycle. Try tracking it now that you know what it is. See if you can taste the difference. Ah! That one also tastes like nothing. So I'll give it a five. Huh? I uncharged alkaline water, another 9.5. Purified using reverse osmosis. Blue triton brands. That is the same brand as serratocus springs. Next time you're having a fancy dinner party with perfect pairing, why don't you get the jug instead? Nerds. Ah! That also tastes like nothing. Am I losing my touch? No, I think I get... And I don't know if this is salinity or pH balance or what the f*** is, but I get this sensation on the middle rear of my tongue that reads as maybe salt or... or minerality. It just does. But every time I've thought that, it's always been a high pH water. So maybe it's pH or maybe it's nothing. Either way, gets a five. Core hydration, perfectly balanced pH 7.4. Your body's natural pH balance, 7.4. So this is like drinking your own body. It's made from 100% recycled plastic and it's very silly looking. And this is especially silly. That's because it is just a normal cap that's embedded inside of this cool cap. You could drink water like it were laundry detergent. Maybe that's what this is for. This is a cup. I don't have to do it this one. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, okay hang on. Made it for 100% recycled plastic, excluding cap and label. It's always the cap and label. And the cap is the dumbest part. It's just unnecessary plastic. So, you know, I'm suck my ass. What, what are you seeing in there? Is that a big in there? You just dump it out and give it to me? Was it a bug? No, I'm a big in there. Ah, it's still in there. The fiber of some kind. Do you see that? Right there? No, this is fine. What you care to tell the folks at home? You said you wanted ocean water. So, I made ocean water for you. April fools day. You sound like that. This time, don't use my actual voice. What do you get it? Zero. Slightly cold. What could that mean? What are you up to over there? What do I... Is that no way? Is unnecessary for the whole of your responsibility? Is there's nothing that you're doing today that would require whatever I just heard? Can't tell if this has salinity to it or if I just still have salt in my mouth. I just f***ing know. A little bit of salinity, but this is normal. I don't know. Six. Sure. Six. Ooh, I'm a 100% recycled bot. You said you couldn't get arrowhead. Here it is, my hands. It came in at the last minute. It was in Iraq today. That's why it's cold. That's what's cold for the delivering truck. Hydrate your way to more rewards. You tell me that this water can reward me in ways other than my health? Let's scan it. Let's scan. Oh s***, our brands. Arrowhead, Deer Park, Ice Mountain, Ozarka, Pure Life. Poland Spring. Huh? Blue Triton Brands. All the things I just said and Saratoga. Wow. Blue Triton was sued by Earth Island Institute in 2021, a non-profit environmental group which claimed that Blue Triton made misleading claims about sustainability that violated consumer protection procedures act, in which they argued that many of the allegedly deceptive statements made by the company constituted non-actionable puffery because they were couched in aspirational terms. So they were like, you were just joking. Yeah, they were like, hey April Fool's, you can't sue us. We were just s*** out and we said that we would do nice things. It was hyperbole. So yeah, they just, to avoid being sued, they just said, we don't believe in anything we say. Okay, well, it's recycled, but we don't know if that's true. Like, what do I do about this? Is that where the label is? Oh, fuck. Yeah, I don't like where this label is. Knock it down. Four. Oh, no, it's you s***. All right, keep it up. Five. Five. Five. Nothing. It's just water. Just like all of these have been, I don't know, s*** dead. Six. We have any dice. That's how I'll start grading these. We got Fiji Earth's finest water. Drop by drop. Fiji water requires the natural minerals and electrolytes that give it signature soft, smooth taste. Produced by nature, there's nothing on Earth quite like it. It's one of the most untrue statements ever said, ever puts a print. Wow, this takes me back to high school when we did a blind taste test of like water. You know, exactly what we're doing here. I remember thinking like, I have to be able to tell which one's Fiji. Everyone will like me if I can just prove that I can know which one's Fiji and I couldn't. And I still can't. Hmm. Oh. Oh, that's water. What do I do, Steve? I'm running out of will. I don't know what I thought the tasting water would be so damn hard. Taste like there's electrolytes. I think I've gotten salinity. I don't think minerality, pH balance, all over the place. Five. Oh, alkaline 88. Never heard of this one. Purified water and has to be the same mineral as it actually dates. Pink hemalay and rock salt. I said it was salty. See, I'm not full of ****. Thank you. Look the ****. Nico. This is coffee. Give me a break. That's not coffee at all. Just one. It sure looks like coffee, but it's not. Oh, God. That's actually gross. It might barely taste like anything, but compared to everything else as far as it's pretty gnarly. I have a funny feeling I know which one this is. Something's familiar about it. Something I've seen in TJ Maxx and Marshalls. It tastes like plastic. Oh, yeah. That was so ****. I mean, it's barely there, but it's enough to be like, what's wrong with this water? It's brown. Give it a one. I don't like it. I like the novelty of it. I do. Okay. I like the novelty of it. I'll give you one point for that. One, which means two. Oh, it's bulk water. Distinctly black. Bulk. Distinctly black. That's not that. BLK period. So that's all I see is distinctly black. Bulk. Bulk beverage is a blend of purified water and are patented, full of mineral complex. Zero caffeine, zero calories, zero sugar, zero dyes. Ooh. Oh, wait a minute. There's secret text. Hold on. They might just bought themselves another point because there's secret text that I see. Look. What does it say? I'm going to start the bottle. Balance love kindness. Well, that was wild. The secret message didn't turn out to be like a cool secret. It was just nice words. Oh, be okay. Balance love kindness. Still not getting your point. I'll give a sh**. Ugh. Hey. Come on now. I drank the whole thing. How did you? There you go. What do you mean, why does I smell every single one? I snorted one of them. Why does I smell it? That looks the same. But something tells me it's not. Mostly because it smells like alcohol. Specifically. I mean, it's probably just water, right? I know it smells a little funny. Yeah. Okay. I shouldn't have done that. Because now I'm not going to be able to taste sh**. What was it? It was vodka. Yeah. You ain't got me. Good one. So the carbon activated vodka. I would give a four to it. I don't really like vodka that much. This is gotta be just the sh**. Yeah. The sh**. Yeah. To the water. Okay. That doesn't smell like anything. But I also can't tell if there's some drunk now. Yeah. Now, this is got the same weird flavor as the bottle one. So same score. But no plastic, right? Yeah. It's a glass. It's a no plastic bean waste. The only thing plastic is the cap. But I'm talking about a lot less plastic here. You get all the incredible flavor of these full-vict mineral drops. I wonder if I'll feel any effects of the alcohol. I've drank so much water. I already do. Why am I drinking all the black water? It's almost like it prompts you to drink it. It's almost like you want to drink it because you think it's coffee or something. I'm gonna give this... Nico. I'm f**king... I'm gonna give this a two because it tastes the same, but there's less plastic waste. And you can put it in vodka if you want. You get all the same health benefits. Water. Question? Cardboard. It's that cardboard flavor. It's back. And it's ejecting. It's ejecting. It's ejecting. It's revenge upon me. I'm gonna give it... But in the four... It gets four. Smart water. 9.5 plus pH. Vapor is still a propurity. Electrolites were taste with antioxidant. Singular. I don't know why that makes me laugh. 10% of your daily selenium. Is that the antioxidant? Sodium selenate. I bet that's where the selenium is from. I bet. I'm not sure he's not dosing me again. I'd be imagining it, but I feel like I'm getting cardboard again. I just really want a nail boxed water when it comes out. So I just keep saying cardboard till we get there. Whoa! That had listed in a very strange flavor. I sh** you not. And that taste is cardboard. It is. It is. Steve. I don't like it, and I'm gonna give it a three. First three of the day. I was rad. Kind of. But, you know, I was. This does have a off flavor. All that to be said, it's very good for the environment. Posting image of this carton with hashtag Better Planet. And we'll plant two trees in a national forest with the NFF. 1.4 million trees are already planted. I don't appreciate that they incorporated advertising into that little schema. Schema. Scheme. The scheme. Environmental positivity. I have rewarded in the past and I sewed two shall I with this by knocking it up to a four from a three. It doesn't taste very good. So, this water looks funny, Nico. What'd you do to it? I just want to say for the record, Nico's got me drunk and is now making fun of me. Now, let's drink this milk. What a good really funny is to put some kind of flavoring in this milk. I just put a little bit of water in it, but it just looked like brown. Oh, wow. Yeah, the work you're looking for is chocolate milk. Let's keep it going. Oh, what does it taste like on its own? I'm going to get my weak swarth of fulvic minerals. Hip. No. Okay. I think it's because it's a base. I think it's like I'm having the reaction I would have if I drank vinegar, but on the other end of the spectrum, because it bothers them in a way that I can't describe. Wait, wait, oh, sh**, right. This is what everybody tuned in for. Because this, presumably, is hella basic. Well, for f**k's sake. I'm going to have to drink this now. Take this away from you. Wait, I never tried the milk. You don't know what it was good. Look, I didn't look. That was awesome. The milk on its own, I'm going to rate it in eight, because milk's good. Milk with the bulk, bulk milk, I'm going to give it nine. Just to be an asshole. There's enough f**king down. Okay, let's take this process seriously. All right, Steve, wipe that smile off your face or I'll wash it out with water. What'd you do to me? What have you done to me? No, that tastes f**king nuts. That tastes nuts. What's wrong with you? Oh, you know what that tastes like? Onvloops. That tastes exactly like when you look an envelope. Just like looking an envelope. So I honestly can't reward that. I'm going to give it a zero. It's awful. I don't want water and taste like this. What is it? Dear Park? I also tasted it. It tastes like onvloops. Confirm? It tastes f**king nuts. You guys try this and you'll be like, he's not drunk. He's smart. We go and talk about too much. Onvloops. Yeah. Back in. Yeah, in the front days. Made from 100% pure envelope saliva. Weird. That might be why, actually, you know, I think about it. So as we were all saying this tastes exactly like onvloops. Which is not, I promise you I didn't think I was going to say that today. That's what you get when you buy water. Where there should be milk. How many more we got? Three. Three. Pepped back up. You got this. Those are real slaps. Okay. We got some more water here. This stuff has a lot of s**t in it. What did you get? There's so much particulate in this, dude. Look at that. You see all the s**t in there? Oh, yeah. That's funny. Oh. Funny is an interesting word for it. It's not like that stuff in it. That's pretty neutral. There is an odd flavor behind it on the tail end. It doesn't punch you in the face like that last water. Like the ear park does. We're just trying to get to your car late at night. The place of knockout game with your taste buds. I don't know if it's real. I'm gonna give it a four. A former sponsor of the show, Sam Sung. Also, I mean, to be fair, we've cleaned that thing out. And it's been a s**t science project in there. So, could be user error. Oh, here's an important question. When do we ever change the filter in there? The filter is like... I'm keeping it. Yeah, that wasn't my question. So, let's go ahead and not hold that against the fine folks at Sam Sung. We're irresponsible. I'm drunk at 3.30 in the afternoon. So... That didn't do anything. That was one of the grossest things ever. Alright, this tastes really like nothing at all. So, I'm going to give it a commissar score of a five. What the hell? Good and gather, purified drinking water. That's ridiculous. Every product that carries the good and gather name starts with quality ingredients. Like water that deliver great taste, making it easier for you and your family to eat well every day. What am I going to eat this? My family? I mean, my family are going to munch down on this s**t water. We promised you'll love each bite. They didn't check this before they were like... We promised you'll love each bite or your money back. I should call them and be like, I didn't like any bite of this water. Oh my god. Look at all the little bubs. Do you see all the little bubs? Did you pour this from a great height? Yeah. My battery. Be serious, Nico. As every water tasted like cardboard since I drank that vodka. You were right about the box though. And you were right about smart water before and after the bottle of the coffee and cardboard. Tastes like a box. It tastes like cardboard, Nico. It's very, very faint. I'm going to pour. What is it? Oh, it makes the holy water with the vase. It's an annoying size. It's 800 milliliters. Why? It doesn't say anything about why it's good. Every expensive water that I've seen has been like, look, you're going to want to pay every dime that this water costs. Otherwise, frankly, you and your family are going to die. Nothing about this is saying why it's expensive and it's pure branding. What score did I give this? I can't remember five, four. What the f***? I will say I do like bottle. Is the last water, yes? Nico's spitting the water in his spine. I know because his spits very sweet. Here I was thinking that I'd be the pranker instead I am the pranker. I will say I've never had water with a little bit of sugar in it. It's not that good. It's not very good. You ever eaten this spoonful of sugar? I certainly have. It tastes like that, but water-y. I don't want to drink anymore. But I have to be objective. It's almost like he tastes the paper that the sugar, the bag the sugar was in. I have so much s*** going around there. I'll give it a charitable three. Well, there you have it, folks. My, all my sixes. And one is seven. That was, I think, not uncoincidentally the first water that I rated. What did we learn today? That when you buy water, it seems like most of what you're paying for is the bottle. As evidenced by the fact that all these pretty much tasted the same. Kind of like most food products, beauty products, health products, prescriptions, electronics, fashion, all of fashion, really. Accessories, handbags, in other words, you're right to be disillusioned, happy, April, full stick. And of course, we got to mix them all together. There it is, folks. Master water. I mean, it does feel a little odd for me to drink it out of a glass, you know. As well. Do it right. That's delicious. Well, there you have it, folks. Whatever that was. Please let me know what bottles of water did we miss. What are your favorites? What do you want to see me rank next? Thank you so much for watching, and please check out the link in the video description to give to the Ugandan Water Project. Thank you so much. Happy you. Pray for fools.
