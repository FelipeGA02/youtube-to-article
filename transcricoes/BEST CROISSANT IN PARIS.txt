 Hi my name is Luisa today. Hi my name is Luisa and today I'm in Paris to try the top five. And we're gonna see which one is the best. So the first one we're gonna check is called... Tutoto. Tutoto. Excuse me. How do you pronounce this? Tutoto du pan. Tutoto du pan. Tutoto du pan. All around the bread. Tutoto du pan. It's very cute inside. It's cute and little. They offer some coffee from the coffee machine. It's not... I do not recommend the coffee they serve. But let's try what we're here for. So the cross zone. It's a 50 euro. With the inflation and everything. It's a good price. The cross zone is lovely. Looks like a typical cross zone. Flaky. It doesn't look that buttery. It's very fluffy and crunchy. Which makes it very good. It's more like a normal neighborhood bakery. So the next one is called carton. Carton. They look like they know what they're doing. They like the flex. They're achievements. Rightfully so. For now they're the best looking ones. This one is the most filled with air. As soon as you touch it it becomes flat. This one is good as it is. Very good. There's many layers. This has almost the perfect shape. This has to be in the top three. Hands down. This was very modern with the Instagram followers counter. But the area. The area is not the best. I mean there's a subway. There's a pub right here. There's a Popeye chicken. There's a train station. And usually in Europe where there's a train station and a McDonald's there's no good people. It's very hard to find good quality in an area like this touristic. It's good that there's a place like this. The next one is called Storer. And it's the oldest one. Storer. Storer. Storer. It's probably the most antique one we're trying today. It was founded in the 1730. Looks pretty classic. Looks very buttery. Not that flaky. See? It doesn't lose too many flakes. It's very thick. That's the thing. Very buttery, very tasty. I don't want to say I'm disappointed with the Storer one. But it's the most normal one. I mean it's the texture, the look. It's probably the one that your grandmother loved. The location. I mean it's pretty unique. 300 years old. But the area is very, very, very touristy. So it doesn't look like a place where you will go on a daily basis. It's more of a historic place. Yeah, as I said, this is not the most interesting one because it's a little thicker than the other ones. It doesn't have all those layers that the other ones have. But it's still very good. It's a normal good person. The next we're going to visit is called Dupin desider. So now we're at the Boulangerie Dupin desider. Very cute, very old. It looks like a jump in the past. So the inside is very 1900 Liberty style. So let's try this one. This was a little bit more expensive. It's flaky, like it's supposed to be. I like that it's not perfect. The shape is not perfect. It reminds me on how not perfect the repeat Santa Poletana. It's not a perfect shape. And this is the same. Wow. You can definitely taste more of vanilla. Probably they put some egg yolk on top and then makes it so good. This is good as is. You don't need anything else. You don't need capucino. You don't need to dip it in milk because it's not dry. There's the right amount of butter. It has a little bit of vanilla taste to it. It's creamy kind of, but there's no creamy inside. And probably that's the effect that the egg gives it. It's so messy eating this. The birds in Paris seems to know when you have a croissant. They come to you because they know there's going to be crumbs. The next one is Cédric Grolez Opera. Sorry for French. I'm not French. I'm not French. Cédric Grolez Opera. There's a huge line. So I asked the guy on the door. The best thing you have croissants? No more croissants. They said to come tomorrow morning. I'm not going to come tomorrow morning. They finished all the croissants. So we left. So we're not going to know how to place them in the rating. Too much work for croissants. I cannot judge it. So it's going to be a question mark. I don't know. It's... It's... It's top five. So it's... It's... Because I only tried five. So yeah. Dupa. It's dizzyed. The not perfect shape makes it so tasty to me. I don't know why. It's buttery. It's flaky. It's very good. All right guys. That was a very good experience trying the real croissant in Paris. And hopefully you enjoyed it as much as I did. And I see you soon.
