 Hey guys welcome back to judo highlights so this is one of the biggest videos of the year that I do Topipons for the year so I went through 17 different events picked out all the best ones Some of them are massive some of them are just outright crazy. I did categorize these a little bit We've got a few highlights from some individuals like Nagayama, Bashayev and then we've got categories like kind of us She was a technique big pickups like this huge one here Foot sweeps and counters and Cochewaza techniques and just before we get into it Thanks to the the channel members for supporting the channel you guys keep this thing running and the hundred-case subscribers We achieve that goal you guys are awesome and by the way Kuzakura they're having a sail right now if you need a judo Guy just send me a DM on Instagram or Facebook Sometimes it's just easier that way so let's get into it. This one here just a incredible Kochi-gadi and to throw someone like this at heavyweight to throw a cyto with this technique Specifically this technique. I mean how often do you see a Kochi-gadi at plus 100's? incredible incredible epon These next two definitely really weird techniques. I mean this one here. I guess you have to call it a kataguruma The entry to the technique very strange almost a little bit like a Taniyotoshi But then he just jumps into the throw Crazy crazy technique and this one kind of similar the way the arms are but this time Bashayev dropping down into some kind of variation of a Sihoye Nagay and While we're on the topic of Bashayev we'll have a look at some of his other epons. They were really great from this year Bashayev he had some some good Sihoye Nagas of his own and you don't see a heavyweight move like that Look at him flicking the ghee shuffling to the side at Plus 100 so that's pretty incredible Next up, I mean this is one of my favorite techniques the Uchi-mata and I just really like this one because of the setup heavily on slow-mo just a little step there and that one too Little bit of ashi waza and then going in. I mean it's just picture perfect So Uchi-mata's here's another one double sleeve From Arai this rising star for Japan So a bunch of Uchi-mata's here Some Arai gochi and a little bit of ulso to as well And have a look at this one Just a flying ulso togari Really got a moving Really trapped that knee. I mean white had nowhere else to go Here's another one almost looks for the the jagura the front Uchi-mata Throws that leg on the outside and that's a massive massive throw Good flexibility in the leg now for this Uchi-mata And watch the setup too Really good as opponent kind of bent over destroyed his posture and then just launched Arai he also had a big ulso though of his own and To throw a dummy in like this is just outstanding Absolutely incredible. We all know how strong Adami in is and pretty sure most people would have gone flying over here to an Uranage but note Arai very strong in that position One of my favorites Nagasai Don't often see him with the the head wrapped up like that, but throwing my line here And I gotta say Nagasai he's probably one of the best at throwing the leg across like that And throwing someone with an ulso togari Nobody throws the leg across like him Now this one here from Bekawuri at first. It doesn't look too pretty But it's quite incredible what he does watch the balance As he switches those legs across the balance is just outstanding Now this variation of ulso toh pretty classic from the Georgians they all like to do it But here salamane de he gets counted by kotsu-ev And look at the pickup That is a big ulso togari Now there were a couple of counters to ulso togari This one's gonna be one of the biggest Watch my sub-it-off pick him up and dump him So it's gonna be this one or the one against salamunzi That kotsu-ev did those two just massive counters to ulso togari Sathalash feeling a little bit of a scramble Took a while for him to get into the position for this technique, but once he secured it Two hands around the body And then he just had to clear a few legs before he went in for that big pickup Another ulso toh now from Aaron Wolf this time Same side sleeve on the pail extremely powerful look at that This one here another really nice ultimatum And as soon as blue starts making that movement to the left Watch why it just jump in there It's waiting for that little side momentum Massive haraigoshi now From the heavyweights in the woman's division A lot of weight coming crashing down on top of you here Would not want to do that on the streets And another one here This one kind of unique harai micikomi does see that too often But look at this Changes of the grips and then goes for it That's a big big throw Speaking of big throws titty rinya And he is probably one of the best in the world at doing this technique haraigoshi I feel like every year he pulls out one of these just massive haraigoshi throws We don't see him too often But when we do see him usually there's something like this that he pulls out Just a beautiful beautiful technique Some people I mean they're cool. I'm kind of a shido master playing the shido game a lot these days Especially in his later years, but I think he's good. I like watching titty rinya Pretty slick I should go to my bike Hukuto here Hukus for kind of like the all-swordogari and then just turns it in the other way Now this might have been the only uchiimata we saw from wolf all year But it was a beauty and I got to say wolf Wolf Aaron has one of the most beautiful uchiimatas in the game Shorter guy, but he makes it work Really pushing down on the head and that just makes people fly This one I probably should have put it with the the ari uchiimata double sleeve uchiimata Both naga yama and ari doing it and similar ways here And watch naga yama's right hand The way he kind of gets behind this this hand and and pulls it kind of pushing it Not really pulling it starts with a push and then ends with a pull Really gets him going This all-soto gonna be one of the biggest Of the year Iponso naga grip and then the way she drove through this Really got silver flying I Guess you got to call that all-soto otoshi This is what you matter all about presence of mind Gets picked up but manages to keep his balance and then on the return finds a new qimata Absolutely incredible look at this As he comes down he's already planting that leg ready for the uchiimata skips the leg over defends the pickup amazing Some sode sori komi goshis now And have a look at this one Almost one hand two hands on the one hand Close if you want to be hushimata level you got to do it with one hand But still this one pretty spectacular And now a couple from the Japanese one from Fuji Sucker But one guy Who really showed us how to do sode sori komi goshis this year Tajima and Tajima I mean he just destroyed people with this technique Here he is throwing jank jank a powerful guy I imagine that would be very hard to do against him And then here another one against Givinoshvili and I've never seen Givinoshvili get thrown like this Just incredible to see him go over like this Absolutely incredible. I do hope we see more of Tajima on the international scene And this sort of here, I mean a running sode sori komi goshi how often do you see this Look at him run with it incredible Some weird techniques now or variations of techniques This kataguruma definitely seeing more of it now Running kataguruma. I mean look at this Puts his head under and then kind of runs with it a little bit Just gets that momentum going His tornado mixing it in with an orchi gari So that is really really unique And takatou I mean he's the master of all sorts of things Look at this counter The orsoto gari just picks his foot up there Sumi otoshi incredible This guy farra he was one of my Favours to watch all year And his obitori gashi I mean it's something It just seems unstoppable once he gets his hands over the top like this I mean it's just such a good technique. It's crazy. You never see Someone like this who has this as a kuiwaza. It's a special technique Yoko otoshi now by Lee And just defends that grip Grabbing around the waist it's a great way to defend that Now this one I mean it's not really an odd technique, but it's an odd way to do Tomoe nage Morigama is the only person who does Tomoe nage In this way It's kind of a Yoko Tomoe nage, but he's doing it Front to back not sideways, which is really interesting This here you're more classic Tomoe nage Just go back in the video Have a look at the difference Morigama seems to kind of be throwing them over his shoulder throwing them to the left where he'll have got Gion throwing him to the right A little section on Ura nage now And it wouldn't be a top ipon's video without some Ura nage And got a couple from nage amma here One of his main go-to techniques these days He's kind of stopped using the seurei nage too much And these days it's a lot of uchi mata and ura nage Here's another one And these ura nage I think one of them was a wasari but I mean they're just so incredible that I just had to include them Or Yoshikan he also had a really nice ura nage And I want to point out the footwork We'll have a look again in slow mo But he does kind of like a little Orchi got a step behind his opponent right here There it is As he kind of puts himself in position I mean that's some really slick work And of course these ura nage highlights wouldn't be complete without Zalash Fili Sometimes the ura nage gets so ridiculous You just want to call them a suplex I mean look at this that's incredible stuff But who did it better Was a Zalash Fili Or Kotsuov here I mean Kotsuov maybe a little bit more height Zalash Fili a little bit more control Still some incredibly powerful ura nage's here And this last ura nage not really big and powerful but just Technically amazing Look at him just position himself Really does a lot of work with the ashi waza and the movement To get behind his opponent And then he just sticks that leg in there And it's all set up for him Couple of Orchi goties now This one from Yondon Paranlei And he really has a beautiful Orchi goti He does this to a lot of people Really driving Orchi goti And getting a bit angry here too Which I like I feel like a little bit of tension on the mat Slick and then this one by torn Or torn a as I should say Similar style driving really low And this kind of Orchi goti with the grip around the back Just works perfectly together I'll be here for me Get some some big orsaltogadis This year specifically at the Tokyo Grand Slam I'm sure there were more than this but we'll just include two in this video And he just excuses techniques So well every time he does it Everyone goes over for ipon It's hard defending this technique from him Because everyone is afraid of that big sode So we're getting to some Koshi was the techniques now Sereinage Tio Toshi This one here, watch the fadeback Kind of a little bit of forward pressure And then as he gets him to go back here End of the Tio Toshi So we've got some Tio Toshis Some Sereinage This one here, big Koshi Gruma That's got to be one of the biggest Throes of the year I mean Abit Ultis opponent just went Full vertical Look at that I didn't rank these at all but If you were going to make a top 10 I mean this this might be there Here's another one that might make that list I mean look at this Tornay throwing Vieru and this Sereinage was so quick And just threw Vieru completely over But I'm going to say this one, this one is well pretty special For Nakamura Watch the little forward pressure Not really a technique that he's looking for Just kind of pushing him With the The step here I mean it could be a Korsothel fake but I mean that just gave him the space To go in So low to the ground I think it's head Shoulders touching the mat Moving up several way classes now same technique And watch the little Lowering of the left shoulder Here I mean that makes all the difference for a Sereinage Tautoshi now by Saito And I really like this combination Ulchiyori And then a Sasai And here comes the Tautoshi Now it's not quite a Suzuki KG Three-piece combo but still It is really nice to see these combinations A heavyweight And the little details I mean watch the little Stutter step backwards Before he goes in for that Tautoshi Jaskets is opponent moving Really important This here one of my favorites Of the whole year By Sendocher And just because he gets counted He gets counted on the way down You can see blue put his foot Behind Sendochers Looking for a bit of ashiwaza But Sendocher uses it And turns it into a beautiful throw This one big Ulchiyori Starts off as an Ulchi But then Gomez throws out his foot Looks for the Harayoshi Doesn't really need it I don't think that was just Extra pain And check out the right foot The little step with the right foot Right there That sets up the entry Very Iliadis like entry there And another one this one just Absolutely massive And to do it from these grips as well Incredible Now this one here just good balance And then finally gets it With the Ulchiy I mean that To pick him up first Stay on his feet Go low not get it And then go Two more times Incredible stuff And just exploded from that This was just a massive Heponsoe Reneger here Now watch his feet As he goes in for the Sereenage I mean he's not even on his feet I have no idea Harayoshi stood up from this position That's the credible strength in his legs I guess For Yerunaa and I guess you gotta call this a Tyle Toshi But we had grip around the back Just demolished his opponent And here's another Demolition Nagayama lightning quick Serei Suryukumi Goshi Watch that look at that Incredible speed from Nagayama This one I really liked it just because I mean white just completely staying one step ahead All of the way It wasn't one moment it was right from this Beerhug Right here he was every step of the way Just ahead Manages to get the throw Get the score Get the hold down Pretty sweet technique here Classic Tyle Toshi Two hands on the one arm Reminds me of the Koreans for sure Drop Siyo U Nagayama don't get much better than this I mean look at that Just threw his opponent flat into the mat Moving on to some Ashiwaza now And I know Uchimata Also the Gari These things are kind of Ashiwaza but Here just looking at more trips Nice to sigh by Lombardo This is actually one of my favorite techniques recently Ashi but I And Kani Kofsky I mean he just executed this perfectly I mean he just gets his opponent walking And he was waiting for it Just making it really awkward for him A Kosato Gake now And pay attention to the grips Sinshing up the hand like that And then reaching for the back It's a really nice way to make things nice and tight As you go on for the Kosato Here's another one Not so much about the grips but the The misdirection Faking forward and then going behind I mean look at that just an incredible reaction And here's another quick one I mean the reactions on this To counter Uchigati And the grips were awkward but he still managed to get it Look at that One of my favorite techniques now Kosato Gake And watch the grips One over the top over the shoulder And the other Underneath Under the armpit I mean this is the go-to way to do this technique So many people do it like this It's a wonderful beautiful technique And this one grip and go Little bit different but still Kosato Gake And look at the surprise on White's face Just couldn't believe he got destroyed like that Really nice Sussai here Using the edge of the mat You can see the forward pressure And then as he felt a little bit of resistance Just went in for it And that grip around the tricep Around the shoulder Really made him Able to pull his opponent in And This one from Smash of this counter I mean Don't blink or you'll miss it Look at that That's so fast So incredible Miserati And he's got some really nice Kosato's He's done this a lot throughout his career And Bobo-no-2 This is probably one of the best Pieces of Uchigata All year I mean have a look at this Just watch Toth go flying Usually I mean people just fall to their back from this technique But you got so much rotation in it These Now Kohara he was a very strong Player for Japan this year And he had a really nice Kosato Ni-da and Kosato And he was throwing a lot of people with this one Really stood out to me In 2023 Through numerous people with this technique And I'm sure a lot of people They started seeing it coming But they just couldn't stop it Very very slick with this Kosato It's kind of like a Ni-da and Kosato Takes two attacks Two stabs at it And here he is throwing Ng's body Look at that There's a lot of detail in this technique A lot of it has to do with the grips That he takes Have a look at his left arm Not in a traditional spot Kind of around the tricep area Really helps him secure this technique And that's it guys The best Epons of 2023 Hope you enjoyed the video See you next year End Olympic year So it's gonna be good And I'll see you then See ya
